BarterBoard: Reviving Barter, Reinventing Exchange.
BarterBoard is a Python-MySQL console application inspired by traditional barter systems, promoting sustainability through the cashless exchange of goods and services. It aligns with four Sustainable Development Goals:
	•	SDG 1: No Poverty - Supporting equitable access to resources for everyone.
	•	SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities - Encouraging community collaboration and reducing waste through local exchanges.
	•	SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - Advocating for mindful resource use and minimizing environmental impact.
	•	SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth - Stimulating economic participation by enabling non-monetary trade opportunities.

This program allows users to explore the BarterBoard, where all available items for trade are listed. Users can propose their own items in exchange, fostering a culture of sharing and collaboration. Features include:
	•	Adding new listings, with options to edit or remove them.
	•	Browsing and managing proposed trades, with the ability to accept or reject them.
	•	Viewing completed exchanges to track contributions and strengthen trust within the community.

By encouraging the reuse of resources, reducing waste production, and supporting equitable exchanges, BarterBoard fosters sustainable practices and stronger communities.
